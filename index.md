## Welcome 

This is a summary of all the games made by me and my kids, mostly for fun in our spare time, and at game jams or hackathons.

![drstrange](images/drstrange.png)

The theme for this 48 hour Game Jam was **Reincarnation**.  

#### Challenges
- What made this game jam more challenging was that both Nathan and Ryan had to work most of Saturday, so had less time to help.
- Also Jim Byer decided not to help us much, but did add his own mini-game, which we included in the menu.
- We had a new team member this year (Nicholas Terry) and had to learn to work as a team with someone we hadn't worked with before.

#### Contributors
- Nathan: Level Design and Animation Rigging
- Ryan: Level Design, Animation Rigging, Sounds and Music
- Nick: Character Controller, Interactables, Modeling
- Me: I worked on the Cut Scenes, Story, Navmesh AI and Programming
- Most the artwork was free from the asset store

#### Result

We won the award for Best Narrative.
