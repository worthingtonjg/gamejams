## Welcome 

I have been making games for fun with friends and family at game jams and hackathons for nearly 10 years.  Almost all these games were made in 48 to 72 hours.  There are two game jams a year that I like to attend.  The Global Game Jam in the spring and the Utah Indie Game Jam in the fall.  

Below you will find the list of all the games I've made over the years in reverse chronological order.

### Shape Factory - 2022 Global Game Jam

![shapefactory](images/shapefactory01.png)

Shape Factory is an exciting 2 player factory matching game. Grab a friend and have fun racing to match all your shapes first! 

#### Rules

- Shapes placed on the main conveyor belt must match the color or shape of the currently displayed shape above. 
- If it doesn't match, you'll get a penalty, and more shapes will be added to your count.
- The shape and color you must match with will update and change to the shape or color of any valid shapes entered in. 
- If none of your shapes match, you can go to the button at the top of your play area and press it to generate a new, random shape (but this will increase your block count, so use it wisely). 
- The first player to match all of their shapes wins! 

#### Controls

- Blue Player/Left Player: WASD keys to move Space Bar to pick up/put down blocks, and push buttons 
- Red Player/Right Player: Arrow keys to move Zero (on Num Pad) to pick up/put down blocks, and push buttons

#### Developer Notes

- This was Andrea's first game jam, but she did a great job with the level design and art work.  The game turned out looking really nice!
- This is a 2 player / split screen game only.  It would be nice to create some AI so you could play against the computer.
- The theme of the game jam was Duality, our idea, was to be able to flip shapes over on the conveyor belt to turn them into sabotages, but we ran out of time and didn't get that implemented.

#### Contributors (left to right)

- Jim Byer (Programming)
- Jon Worthington (Programming)
- Andrea Blake (Art and Level Design)

### Global Game Jam 2018 - Tran (A Tron Spoof)

![tran](images/tran.png)

The theme of this 48 hour game jam was "Transmission".  Being computer nerds, we decided to make a movie inspired entry based on Tron.  We took movie clips directly from both the 1982 version of the movie and the 2010 version of the movie and integrated them into our game to introduce each of our levels.   

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron>

#### Controls: 

- Player 1: AWSD (QE)
- Playser2: JKIL (OU)

#### Developer Notes

- The effect of the movie clips makes the game seem more polished than it really is.  
- Also we used some really cool glow effects in all the levels that I feel really added a good look and feel to the game.
- The free assets we used were: MK Glow Free, Sprite Glow, Kino Bloom, Fungus, Cyber Soldier

#### Contributors

- *Programming* - Jon Worthington (me) and Jim Byer
- *Modeling & Texturing* - Nathan Worthington (17 years old)
- *Level Design* - Ryan Worthington (12 years old)

![crazy](images/crazy.png)

The theme of this 48 hour game jam was "Pacifist".  This was one of three entries that we submitted. 

It started out as just a distraction to keep me awake the 2nd night, but turned into my final entry.  Mainly because I had more fun making it than I had making what was our primary entry.  

Watch very poorly 2D render - ed talking heads say not-so-random quotes that are sometimes from famous pacificsts.

#### Developer Notes

### Global Game Jam 2017 - Laugh Kingdom

The theme of this 48 hour game jam was "Waves".  My 12 year old son at the time, wanted to
make a game that had jokes in it.  So we decided that since sounds are waves, we would make
a game where you collect jokes.  

![laugh](images/laugh.png)

Laugh Kingdom is a LAN network multiplayer game written in Unity using Unity networking.

Players are racing against each other to collect the most jokes and fill their joke meter. The king has a terrible temper, and the only thing that will cheer him up is the most notable type of WAVE ~ the sound wave. All his peasants must collect jokes and funny insults to compete to become his court jester. The losers will be fed to the lions.

### Gameplay Video

### Virtual Band - 2016 Microsoft Build Hackathon

![virtualband](images/virtualband.png)

Running on a treadmill is not nearly as enjoyable as running outside. But due to weather and time constraints sometimes that is our only choice. We were inspired by this to create an app that allows you to run through a level of your choice using just your treadmill, a tablet and your Microsoft Band.

#### Developer Notes
- Built at the 2016 Microsoft Hackathon
- The MS Band API could not be referenced directly by Unity therefore was written in the UWP layer and used messaging to communication with Unity.
- We had a great time at the Hackathon
